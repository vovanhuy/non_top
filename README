1. Group members: VO Van Huy and NGUYEN Ta Duy

2. Two principle Java source files are Accepted.java and ReadFiltration.java.
	- ReadFiltration.java provides classes to read filtrations from files
	- Accepted.java provides a class (Accepted) to build boundary matrix,
	reduce boundary matrix and build barcodes

3. A C++ source file used for generating filtrations of d-balls and d-spheres:
	filtration_generator.cpp

4. Filtrations that we construct for classical spaces can be found in folder
data/ 

5. A ipython notebook is given in folder python/ containing visualization of
some filtrations

6. The answers for the questions as well as a complexity analysis is given in
the file report.pdf

7. To construct barcodes of a filtration contained in filtration.txt and output 
results to filtration.barcode, type in the terminal:
	javac Accepted.java
	java Accepted filtration.txt filtration.barcode

8. To generate a filtration for d-ball and d-sphere and output results in a file
output.txt, type in the terminal:
	g++ -std=c++11 filtration_generator.cpp -o filtration_generator
	./filtration_generator d type > output.txt
where type is ball or sphere
