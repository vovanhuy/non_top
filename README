	java Accepted filtration.txt filtration.barcode

3. To generate a filtration for d-ball and d-sphere and output results in a file
output.txt, type in the terminal:
	g++ -std=c++11 filtration_generator.cpp -o filtration_generator
	./filtration_generator d type > output.txt
where type is ball or sphere
